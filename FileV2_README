FamilyTreeInputTextFileV2

In updating this file, I added spaces between each comma that does not have a value. This will make reading in the file easier. If a space is encountered, that value can be 
entered as null or -1 to represent that this information is not known. Each set of information (Person, Children, Relationship) is separated by a line of commas to distinguish
between the type of information being read in.
